think about it ï¼ši need design a robot for a lathe 
i need build 3D module, choose the servermotor, identify how many things the robot can do 
how much weight it can load
but , you know, in market, we have so many robot products, so many designer do the same thing again and again
can we use the mass production ? can we use a base module to avoid to do the same thing others already do ?
